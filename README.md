# Random Password Generator

## Description

This random password generator is for users looking to create strong passwords. This project is built to create a variety of difficult to guess passwords for users. The main goal is to provide random password options to users including uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters. 

As a computer user I want to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria so that I can create a strong password that provides greater security for my accounts.

## Usage
When I load the password generator, then I am presented with a Generate a Password Box and a red "Generate Password" button to click to begin generating a randomized password. 

To use this Password Generator, you can click "Generate Password" to create a strong password for your accounts. For example: if you select "Generate Password" the site will ask you how many characters you would like to use between 8-128 characters. After you input that information, it will ask you if you would like to include lowercase letters (Ok means yes and cancel means no). Next, it will ask you if you would like to include uppercase letters, then numbers, and finally special characters.
